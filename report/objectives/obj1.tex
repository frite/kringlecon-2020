\chapter{Objective 1}

\section{Introduction}

During our visit {\color{codegreen}Jingle Ringford} (located in the Staging area),
gave us our first objective. Find out what's written in Santa's list. He also gave us two hints on how to achieve this.
Although this is indeed achievable with \href{https://www.photopea.com}{Photopea}, Grinch had lying around a copy of
\href{https://www.gimp.org}{GIMP}.

\subsection{Solution}
First, we need to grab the image.
\begin{minted}{bash}
$ wget https://kringlecon.com/textures/billboard.png
\end{minted}

Although the filter you are looking for in Photopea is indeed called (Filters/Distort/Twirl), in GIMP it is called
\textit{Whirl and Pinch}. For GIMP, adjusting the Pinch also helps.

\subsection{Answer}
The answer is Proxmark.

- Grinch, stop reading the narrative over and over, let's head up on the castle.
- Uh yeah, you are right Cindy Lou.
