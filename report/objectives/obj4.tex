\chapter{Objective 4}

\section{Introduction}

Our heroes were heading towards the elevator. As they were passing through the Great Room, Grinch saw a splunk screen.
As he tried to log in, {\color{codegreen}Angel Candysalt} came rushing in the room. It turns out that Splunk is charging \footnote{I like Splunk, I'm just highlighting the subtle art of "The more sources the merrier, we may not need them and my rules may make no sense but I don't man that chair so I'm ok, merging my rules in production, kbye now.".} tons of money so only Santa and some elves are allowed to touch it.
The others were caught adding in random sources without properly QAing them. Not only the bill skyrocketed, we were buried with alerts.

Our two heroes started feeling like Santa had betrayed them but they continued with the elevator.

\textit{Narrator steps in again} If you inspect closely the data sent by the https://elevator.kringlecastle.com you will see that some data is passed in in the URL.
Up to this point, there is another nut that I haven't mentioned located near the Javascript machine. Using Chrome's tools, you can actually "get" all items available.

Altering the object is easy, you can directly add whatever objects/attributes you want in the URL, as evidenced in the following printscreen.
